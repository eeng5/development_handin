                    <br>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to get more comfortable using React. It encouraged us to think about
                        how to create different elements of the website using components, props, and states, and why our
                        choices made sense. For this project includes the following features:
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 filtering categories</li>
                        <li>1 sorting feature</li>
                        <li>an aggregator section on the same page displaying items added to the aggregator and a total
                            price aggregator</li>
                        <li>12 item cards displaying the item image, categories that the filters use, the field the sort
                            function uses, the property to be aggregated, and a button that adds the item to the
                            aggregator
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    This application was designed to handle any combination of filters, and was built to ensure that all
                    filters and sorting methods can work together without crashing the page. Additionally, an "all"
                    option was added each of the filters to resort back to the original state without refreshing the
                    page. In each item card there is the option of add the item to the cart, and within the shopping
                    cart there is the option to remove the added items. The total price updates accordingly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, the goal of the project is that same as the intended value for the user: the design should
                    be intuitive and easy to use. The user should be able to easily understand the purpose of the
                    filtering buttons, the sorting fields, and the aggregator, and they should be able to effectively
                    "purchase" their desired items.

                    <br>
                    <p>Describe the usability principles considered (i.e. how it relates to user interface design
                        principles youâ€™ve learned so far).
                        Usability can be defined as the capability of a software product to be understood, learned,
                        used, and be attractive to the user, when used under specififed conditions. This is incredibly
                        important in the development of a website UI since the main objective of the website is for it
                        to be used. The interface design principles that were considered in the creation of this website
                        are as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>alignment: </b>I made all of the components on the page centered in order to make the
                            website more readable and clean. I used flexbox to arrange them in a way that would be
                            responsive to the size of the screen being used.</li>
                        <li><b>typography: </b>Legibility is incredibly important. Therefore, I made sure to use a font
                            and typeface that are simple and easily-readable.</li>
                        <li><b>contrast: </b>This principle affects reading and attention. I decided to make the
                            background image for my page dark to emphasize my page's content, and to also make the text
                            color and buttons dark to stand out agaist the card background color (white). Additionally,
                            I decided to make the color of the title white to match with the content-containing cards on
                            the page.</li>
                        <li><b>color palette: </b>For my color palette, I choose to stick to basic contrasting shades:
                            neutral darks, lights, and browns. My reasoning was that I would let the exciting colors of
                            stickers speak directly to the user, and not introduce any distractions in the form of a
                            more bright and potentially-distracting color scheme.</li>
                        <li><b>texture: </b>This principle has the potential to really change the <i>feel</i> of an
                            interface. Because my website is selling sticker, I thought it would make sense to use paper
                            for the background of the site, to give the impression of stickers on a paper. Therefore I
                            chose an image of brown paper which has a realistic texture. My goal with this is to get the
                            user in the mood for purchasing stickers by seeing a surface on which they could apply the
                            items I'm selling.</li>
                        <li><b>grouping: </b>I made sure to organize the visual elements of my page in a way that would
                            allow the user to browse the website with maximum clarify and efficiency. I made use of
                            whitespace to create clean organization, and grouped filtering, sorting, and aggregator
                            functions at the top of the page while the list of products is grouped underneath them.</li>
                        <li><b>simplicity: </b>Most importantly, I tried to keep the design of my page simple. I want it
                            to be clear to the user what we are selling, and how they can go about making a purchase.
                            Not using too many colors and using whitespace for organization instead of lines effectively
                            accomplishes this goal.</li>

                    <br>
                    <p>Working on this project was very beneficial for my understanding of React. Learning how to use
                        components, props, and state can initially seem complex, but ultimately it streamlines the
                        process of UI development and allows for easier changes and efficient component-reuse. Thinking
                        about the relationship between parent and child components also encourages the developer to
                        consider the logical hierarchy of their project, and how the structure their code will be
                        reflected in the usability of the site for the user.</p>
